# Simple Blockchain in Golang

This repository contains a basic implementation of a blockchain that uses the Proof of Work (PoW) mechanism to securely add blocks. 

## What is this Repository About?

The core of this project demonstrates how to:
- Create blocks containing data and securely add them to a blockchain.
- Implement the Proof of Work algorithm to validate the mining process.
- Use hashing to ensure the integrity and linkage of the blocks in the chain.
