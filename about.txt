Blockchain is essentialy a pucblic database that is dirtubuted among multiple differnt peers
It doesnt rely on trust
Previously, in dirtibuted systems, every node would be trustworthy, 
i.e., data coming from each and every node would have coorect data inside it 

With blockchain however, one of the nodes could be producing incorrect data,
i.e., 49% of your nodes could be producing i coorect data. 
As the database now doent really need to rely on trusting, we can do really cool stuff with vlockhains 

To represrnt a block inside golang, 
we create a struct which has 
1. hash - represents the hash of the block 
2. data field - represtns the data which could be ledgers, documents and images
3, previous hash - represents the last blco's hash, it allows us to link the hashes together, like in a linked list
each block in our blovkchain refernces the last block created indie the blockchain 

We now create a method "DeriveHash" 
which allows us to create hash based on the previous hash information 
bytes.Join() -> is used to join the slices of bytes together
the first parameter on that is a two dimensional slice of bytes which is cmonined with an empty slice of bytes 
we create the actual hash by using by sha256 hasing function 
we then take the created hash and push it into the hash field of our Block.

We now create a function called CreateBlock
This is used to createthe atcual block 

Here, we use the Block contructor (which is a reference ot the block), 
Inside this, we put in an empty slie of byte, we use the data fiels and convert it into a slice of bytes, and then use the prevhash

We then create a method which will allow us to add the block to the blockchain
